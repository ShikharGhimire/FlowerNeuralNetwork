Created my first ios app that uses custom Convolutional Neural Network

कुन फूल?- This folder consists of all the files with code for ios app. Thanks to pyimagesearch.com for his article that helped me massively to create this app.

smallVGGnet.py- This file consists of the algorithm of my custom Convolutional Neural Network

train.py- This file consits of the algorithm for data augmentation and fit the data in CNN that i created in smallVGGnet.py and train the network. This algorithm also saves the trained model in your disk

classify.py - This file helps you to classify new images using the command line arguments
